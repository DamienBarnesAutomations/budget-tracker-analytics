📊 Expense Reporting Pipelin

Overview
This project is a lightweight data pipeline and dashboard for analysing personal travel expenses. It ingests CSV exports from a mobile budgeting application, cleans and normalises the data, and presents it through a simple, read-only dashboard.
The focus is on clarity and maintainability rather than complex analytics.

Input
The system ingests CSV exports generated by the Travel Spend budgeting application.
CSV files are submitted manually via a Telegram bot, which validates the file type, downloads the data, and triggers the processing pipeline.

Trigger
Processing is manually triggered when a user submits a CSV file to the Telegram bot. There are no scheduled jobs or background tasks; each run is explicitly initiated by file submission.

Processing
After ingestion, the CSV file is loaded and cleaned to produce a single canonical dataset. This step focuses on normalisation and basic validation to ensure the data is consistent and ready for downstream use. No complex analytics or enrichment is performed at this stage.

Storage
The cleaned dataset is written to a single worksheet in Google Sheets. Each run overwrites the existing data, ensuring the sheet always reflects the most recent upload.

Output
The processed data is presented through a Streamlit dashboard that reads directly from Google Sheets. The dashboard provides summary metrics and visualisations of spending over time, by category, and by country. It is read-only and reflects the most recent uploaded dataset.

Purpose
The system was built to provide a clear, consistent view of spending over time, enabling budget decisions to be based on actual data rather than intuition. By normalising and visualising expense data, it makes it easier to compare current behaviour with past periods and adjust spending accordingly.
